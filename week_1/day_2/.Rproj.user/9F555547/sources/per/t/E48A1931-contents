# MVP 

* Create a folder in the directory where you're keeping your work files. Call it `codeclan_homework_yourname` (insert your name as something like `DelMiddlemiss`).

```
mkdir codeclan_homework_yourname
```

* Initialise a Git repository in the folder

```
cd codeclan_homework_yourname
git init
```
* Create a `week_01` folder and `cd` into it, then create a `day_1` folder and `cd` into that.

```
mkdir week_01
cd week_01
mkdir day_01
cd day_01
```

* Create a couple of `.txt` files in the folder

```
touch first.txt
atom first.txt
```
*Now edit the file in atom then close atom*

```
touch second.txt
atom second.txt
```
*Now edit the file in atom then close atom*

* Stage the files

```
git add .
```
* Commit the files

```
git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
```

* Make a change to each file

```
atom first.txt
```
*Now edit the file in atom then close atom*

```
atom second.txt
```
*Now edit the file in atom then close atom*


* Commit the changes

```
git commit -m "Commit message about your new changes"
```

Working remotely at [GitHub](https://github.com/):

* Create a new repository -- call it `codeclan_homework_yourname` (again, insert your name as something like `DelMiddlemiss`)

Back on your computer:

* Add the GitHub remote to your local
* Push to the remote repository

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusename/codeclan_homework_yourname.git
git push -u origin master
```

# Extension

* Create a `.gitignore` file

```
touch .gitignore
```
* Tell it to ignore a file called `file_to_ignore.txt`

```
atom .gitignore
```
*Now edit the file in atom, write the line: file_to_ignore.txt, then close atom*

* Stage it, commit it and push it to the remote

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added a gitignore"
git push
```
* Create `file_to_ignore.txt` 

```
touch file_to_ignore.txt
```
* Add some text to it

```
atom file_to_ignore.txt
```
*Now edit the file in atom then close atom*

* Use `git status` to check that `file_to_ignore.txt` isn't being tracked by Git

```
git status
```
